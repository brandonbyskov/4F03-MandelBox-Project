----------------------


to set the number of threads on your computer, use
> export OMP_NUM_THREADS=X
where X = 1,2,..,32
Use 32 threads on the school computers, GPU1 and GPU2.

Timing Runtime
----------------------
Whenever you want to try an optimization, test whether it actually improves performance.
Don't commit anything and rearrange the code unless it actually improves the runtime.
"Real Time" is the actually time that the program takes to run. 

Test before and after the changes using:
On linux:
> time ./mandelbox params.exe
On Windows
> Measure-Command {mandelbox.exe params.dat}

Verify Correct Image
----------------------
To verify that the changes are still outputting the correct image, compare it with
the original image we got with unedited code:
> cmp image.bmp base.bmp
output should be nothing if images are the same, the difference if they are different.

If you are optimizing certain floating point operations, there could be cases where
the output image is not exactly the same, but very close. If this is the case, visually
inspect the image.
